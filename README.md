this a to do-list that makes your day a bit more productive all you have to do is write your tasks in the order you would like and then when you finish it just check it and if you 
you are done with your tasks for the day then just press x on all of them to delete them and start fresh.

this to do-list also saves your data so when you refresh or quit the to do-list dont be scared that your tasks will be gone.

i actually use it myself because it is just better and more interactive than most windows apps like sticky notes or notepad, because these appsare not only made for writing your tasks for the day but this one is.
